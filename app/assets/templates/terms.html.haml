      %h2 1. Agreement

      %p When you use our Services, you are entering into a legal agreement and you agree to all of these terms.
      You also agree to our Privacy Policy, which covers how we collect, use, share, and store your personal information.
      You agree that by clicking “Sign Up” or similar, registering, accessing or using our services (including our related mobile apps, developer platforms, premium services, or any content or information provided as part of these services, collectively, “Services”), you are entering into a legally binding agreement (even if you are using our Services on behalf of a company). If you reside in the United States, your agreement is with Skillster Corporation. 
      This “Agreement” includes this User Agreement and the Privacy Policy, and other terms that will be displayed to you at the time you first use certain features (such as starting a “Group,” downloading one of our software applications or purchasing advertisements), as may be amended by Skillster from time to time. If you do not agree to this Agreement, do NOT click “Join Now” (or similar) and do not access or otherwise use any of our Services.
      Registered users of our Services are “Members” and unregistered users are “Visitors”. This Agreement applies to both.

However, if law requires that you must be older in order for Skillster to lawfully provide the Services to you (including the collection, storage and use of your information) then the Minimum Age is such older age. The Services are not for use by anyone under the age of 13.

These rights are limited in the following ways:
      You can end this license for specific content by deleting such content from the Services, or generally by closing your account, except (a) to the extent you shared it with others as part of the Service and they copied or stored it and (b) for the reasonable time it takes to remove from backup and other systems.
      We will not include your content in advertisements for the products and services of others (including sponsored content) to others without your separate consent. However, we have the right, without compensation to you or others, to serve ads near your content and information, and your comments on sponsored content may be visible as noted in the Privacy Policy.
      We will get your consent if we want to give others the right to publish your posts beyond the Service. However, other Members and/or Visitors may access and share your content and information, consistent with your settings and degree of connection with them.
      While we may edit and make formatting changes to your content (such as translating it, modifying the size, layout or file type or removing metadata), we will not modify the meaning of your expression.
      Because you own your content and information and we only have non-exclusive rights to it, you may choose to make it available to others, including under the terms of a Creative Commonslicense.
      You agree that we may access, store and use any information that you provide in accordance with the terms of the Privacy Policy and your privacy settings.

      %h3 3.3. Other Content, Sites and apps

      %p When you see or use others' content and information posted on our Services, it's at your own risk.

      By using the Services, you may encounter content or information that might be inaccurate, incomplete, delayed, misleading, illegal, offensive or otherwise harmful. Skillster generally does not review content provided by our Members. You agree that we are not responsible for third parties' (including other Members') content or information or for any damages as result of your use of or reliance on it.
      You are responsible for deciding if you want to access or use third party apps or sites that link from our Services. If you allow a third party app or site to authenticate you or connect with your Skillster account, that app or site can access information on Skillster related to you and your connections. Third party apps and sites have their own legal terms and privacy policies, and you may be giving others permission to use your information in ways we would not. Except to the limited extent it may be required by applicable law, Skillster is not responsible for these other sites and apps -- use these at your own risk. Please see Sections 2.6 and 2.7 of the Privacy Policy.

      %h3 4.2. Exclusion of Liability

      %p These are the limits of legal liability we may have to you.

      THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS PART OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN YOU AND Skillster  AND SHALL APPLY TO ALL CLAIMS OF LIABILITY (E.G. WARRANTY, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, CONTRACT, LAW) AND EVEN IF Skillster  HAS BEEN TOLD OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH DAMAGE, AND EVEN IF THESE REMEDIES FAIL THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.
      SOME LAWS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY, SO THESE LIMITS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

      %h2 5. Termination

      %h2 7. General Terms

      %p Here are some important details about how to read the Agreement.
      If a court with authority over this Agreement finds any part of it not enforceable, you and us agree that the court should modify the terms to make that part enforceable while still achieving its intent. If the court cannot do that, you and us agree to ask the court to remove that unenforceable part and still enforce the rest of this Agreement. To the extent allowed by law, the English version of this Agreement is binding and other translations are for convenience only. This Agreement (including additional terms that may be provided by us when you engage with a feature of the Services) is the only agreement between us regarding the Services and supersedes all prior agreements for the Services.
      If we don't act to enforce a breach of this Agreement, that does not mean that Skillster  has waived its right to enforce this Agreement. You may not assign or transfer this Agreement (or your membership or use of Services) to anyone without our consent. However, you agree that Skillster  may assign this Agreement to its affiliates or a party that buys it without your consent. There are no third party beneficiaries to this Agreement.
      We reserve the right to change the terms of this Agreement and will provide you notice if we do and we agree that changes cannot be retroactive. If you don't agree to these changes, you must stop using the Services.
      You agree that the only way to provide us legal notice is at the addresses provided in Section 10.
